## LabelAsTooltips
Hi,
I am writing to share a custom solution I have developed for displaying labels with tooltips in Dynamics 365. As you may know, there is no out-of-the-box control available for this functionality in D365. To address this gap, I have designed a custom control that can be applied to Single Line of Text fields.

Solution Details:

**Display**: The control will show the actual display name of the field.
**Tooltip**: The description of the field will be used as the tooltip, providing additional information when users hover over the label.

This control enhances the user experience by providing contextual information without cluttering the interface.
 **you can download control from here**
